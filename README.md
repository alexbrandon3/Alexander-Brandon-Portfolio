# My Portfolio

## About

This application serves as an informative showcase of the programming skills I've acquired throughout UNC's Full Stack Flex coding program. My contact information, resume, and applications I have developed for class may be found here. I have formatted my landing page for screens 480px and 1024px in order to cover mobile and traditional browser windows.
