        <p>My name is Alexander Brandon, and I am one of a kind. I grew up in the Charlotte area of North Carolina, attended Appalachian State University, and graduated with a bachelor's degree in accountancy. After graduation, I worked in the field for a few years until tragedy struck. On December 24, 2018 I suffered four major strokes which ultimately delivered me a prognosis of a lifetime of quadriplegia. Despite medical professionals nationwide looking into my case, the cause of my strokes has never revealed itself, but despite this I have worked tirelessly every day since my strokes and am fortunate enough to see the mobility and functionality of my body being slowly restored over time. I am optimistic that I will make a full recovery. In the days after my strokes when I'd finally returned home from the hospital but was bound to a recliner all day, I began learning to program to occupy my mind, and I was pleased to find a new passion. One I could take with me regardless of how far my recovery went. Now that I am physically able to once again consider returning to work, I have decided to commit to programming as a career by enrolling in the full stack flex developing boot camp with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. For the first time in years, I am excited for the future!</p>
